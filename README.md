Edit pose of an object in a scene
This problem statement involves two tasks 
1) The first task (task1.ipynb) is to segment an object (defined by a user given class prompt) in a given scene.
This enables the ‘user-friendly’ part of the problem statement.
   This uses SAM for segment out the object of interset in the scene by giving prompts. LaMa is used to preserve the background scene. 

2) The second task (task2.ipynb) is to edit the pose of the object by taking user poses (e.g. Azimuth +10 degrees, Polar -5
degrees).
